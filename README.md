### Locate Essential Services on the Island of Montreal

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, government lockdown restrictions and the increasing risk of disease transmission have made access to essential service providers a significant social priority. 

For this project, I created a web page which allows users to search for essential services across the Island of Montreal by indicating their current location or desired location on a map, and querying the type of essential service they would like to locate. The page will then display the name and location of the closest service to the user's selected location. 

For the beta version, the user can select between grocery stores, pharmacies, and hospitals. For future iterations, more locations within each essential service category and more essential service categories can be added.
